## My Recommend

Use **Visual Studio Code**. It's a lightweight and beautiful code Editor for me.

You can also use Microsoft Word to write HTML code. But you have to select **save as HTML or save as webpage** to save the HTML file.

You can also use your default notepad. In this case you have name the file as .html

**For Example:** index.html, about.html, and so on...
