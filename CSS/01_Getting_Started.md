# CSS

**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** is a programming language that specifies how a document written in a markup language should appear. This includes HTML and XML, as well as XML dialects like MathML, SVG, and XHTML.

CSS is a core technology of the World Wide Web, along with HTML and JavaScript. It's a fundamental programming language for web design, allowing designers to create multiple pages with the same formatting.

CSS describes how elements should appear on screen, paper, in speech, or other media. It's made up of coding elements called "cascading style sheets", which are also known as CSS files.
